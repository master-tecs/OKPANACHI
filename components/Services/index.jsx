            details="We adopt a systematic approach to our audit engagements. This requires us to study the clients system of internal control and to evaluate it in order to identify the features that are important to the audit. This evaluation enables us to determine the controls on which we propose to rely and to take this into account in deciding our programme of audit tests.
 
            Main Elements of the Firm’s Audit Approach 
            The single most important element is applying the firm’s audit approach on the exercise of informed judgments at various stages of the audit. This requires that important decisions are made by the senior people on the audit i.e. the engagement partner and manager, based on their understanding of the client’s industry, business, organization and accounting system.
             
            The firm’s audit approach is directed to the expression of an opinion on the accounts and is summarized below. We would:
             
            (a) Familiarize our self with the clients business and organization including those  	organizational arrangements and control procedures (financial controls) that:
             
            (i) Provide conditions under which the system of accounting and internal controls can operate efficiently; and
            (ii) In part, monitor performance of the accounting system.
             
            (b) Obtain an understanding and record of the client’s accounting system, including the procedures and controls incorporated in it and review selected transactions to confirm that we have understood and recorded the system properly.
             
            (c) Evaluate the internal control with the aid of internal control questionnaires (ICQs) to identify:           	
            (i)Those internal accounting controls upon which we propose to place reliance;  and
            (ii) Any apparent weakness in the system.
                             Internal Accounting Controls Comprise:
            (i)                 Basic controls, i.e. those controls designed to ensure that transactions are recorded   completely and accurately. Basic controls include such features as control accounts and numerical controls to ensure that all sequentially numbered documents are accounted for.
             
            (ii)               Discipline over basic controls, i.e. those features of a system that are designed to ensure that the basic controls continue to operate properly and that the assets are safeguarded. Discipline over basic controls comprise divisions of duties, separation of the custody of assets from the accounting responsibility for them, physical arrangement that prevent unauthorised access to assets or accounting records, and supervision of the result of one persons work by another. The effectiveness of the discipline over basic controls will determine our ability to rely on the continuity of operation of the basic controls and the extent to which it is necessary to carry out tests of the basic controls themselves.
             
            (d) Discussions with the clients the apparent weaknesses identified in the system, i.e. weaknesses shown by the answers to the questions relating to each control objective.
             
            (e) Carry out compliance tests.
                It is the firms policy that we should carry out a programme  of compliance tests on those internal accounting controls on which we plan to rely to ensure the continued and proper operation of the accounting system.  
             
            Compliance tests are designed to provide evidence that the internal accounting controls as identified in the ICQ are being operated as planned. Compliance tests involve examination of evidence (records, documents, reconciliation, reports for evidence that a specific control appears to have been properly applied) and reperformance (repeating either in whole or part of the same procedure performed by the clients employees.
             
            When carrying out these tests we should review the nature and reasonableness of the transaction recorded, observe generally the circumstances in which the operations are being carried out, and be alert to any thing that seems to be out of the ordinary.
             
            The following categories of control will be tested:
            -          Basic controls
            -          Segregation of  duties
            -          Supervisory controls
            -          Physical controls
            -          Integrity controls (in  computer system)
             
             
            (f) Management letters
            After we have completed the evaluation of internal control and the compliance tests, we could report to the client or internal control deficiencies that have come to our attention. If additional matters come to our attention as a result of substantive tests, these would be reported to the client.
             
            (g) Substantive tests.
            Substantive tests represent the final stage of the audit leading to the expression of an audit opinion. They comprise direct tests of account balances and other information contained in the account and certain other procedures/tests of a more general nature that indirectly provide evidence of the validity of the amount appearing in the accounts.
            Substantive tests are generally directed towards balance sheet and profit and loss (Income and Expenditure) account items.
             
            (h)  Audit Opinion
            After completing the various steps, set out above we would then be in a       position to draft out audit report on the accounts.   If difficulties become apparent or if there are matters, which make it difficult for us to give a clean audit report, we would immediately discuss these with our clients to see whether some alternative or additional information can be produced to solve the problem.
             
            The objective of this approach is to perform an effective audit at lowest cost,  	taking maximum account of the internal accounting procedures set up by the client to ensure the completeness and accuracy of the processing of accounting information and the custody of assets.
